# 📈 Stock Price Prediction System

Welcome to **StockPrediction** — a Machine Learning-based project to predict stock market prices using historical data.  
This project builds and evaluates models to forecast stock prices, helping users make informed decisions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data collection and visualization
- Stock price prediction using Machine Learning models
- Regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.)
- Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices
- User-friendly outputs and graphs

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation
- **NumPy** — Numerical computations
- **Scikit-Learn** — ML models and evaluation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** — Data visualization
- **yfinance** — Fetching real-time stock data

## 📈 How it Works

1. Fetch stock market data using `yfinance` or a CSV file.
2. Perform feature engineering on time-series data.
3. Train ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
4. Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE or R² score.
5. Visualize the actual vs predicted prices.
6. Make future stock price predictions.

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deeps-2005/StockPrediction.git
   cd StockPrediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook StockPredictor.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Example Output

- Graphs comparing actual stock prices vs model predictions.
- Error metrics (RMSE, MAE, R² Score).

---

## 📚 Future Improvements

- Integrate Deep Learning models (LSTM, GRU).
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.
- Add financial indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, etc.
- Backtest predictions over historical stock data.
